            <h3>Computer Scientist | Web Developer</h3>
            <br></br>
            <p> I have a B.Sc degree in Computer Science from the University of Iceland.
                Currently, I'm studying Web Communications at the same university.
                I have always been interested in web development, which is my main focus, as
                well as UX design.               
                In my spare time I knit, watch movies and take pottery courses.
            </p>
